## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this project was to assist a Colorado Board of Elections employee with retrieving specified information from a large data set of local election results. From the .csv file of election results, I was to write a Python script which would allow me to retreive the following information:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Calculate the total votes cast within each county represented in the data set
3. Determine the county with the highest number of votes cast
4. Pull a complete list of the candidates who received votes
5. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
6. From that vote total, calculate the percentage of the total votes each candidate received
7. Determine the winner of the popular vote from this election data

## Election Audit Results
My analysis of the election results data showed that:
  - 369,711 total votes were cast in this election
  - The 3 counties represented in this data set represented the following percentages of the overall vote:
